# FlyKey: On-the-Fly Keybinding for Emacs

FlyKey is a tool to improve efficiency in editing repetitive documents
in Emacs by allowing you to insert text with a custom, on-the-fly set
of keybindings.

# To do:
## Delete keybindings when you remove them from the flyk file.
## Fix bug to prevent killing the insertbuf.
