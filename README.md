# FlyKey: On-the-Fly Keybindings for Emacs

FlyKey is a tool to improve efficiency in editing repetitive documents
in Emacs by allowing you to insert text with a custom, on-the-fly set
of keybindings.

## To do:
* Replace shell script functionality with Emacs Lisp code.
* Don't compile the keymap unless there is a valid line in the flyk file.
* Fix bug which is preventing new flyk files from being made.
* Find source of "selecting deleted buffer" error.
